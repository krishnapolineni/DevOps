Procedure to integrate GitHub with Jenkins (SSH)

1--> Run ssh - keygen command as jenkins user. It will create .ssh in Jenkins home directory ( i.e, /var/lib/jenkins this is mine ) and copy the
     id_rsa.pub key present in .ssh directory.
    copying the code: cat /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   by using this command it will display a encrypted code and copy that code.

2--> Go to GitHub home page in browser then go to settings ---> select Deploy keys option, there enter title what u want and paste the encrypted     
     public key in below and tick for allow write access. then finally press add key button in bottom.   

3--> Now use ssh git url in Jenkins or Linux server
