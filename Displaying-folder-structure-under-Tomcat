Displaying folder structure under Tomcat

1.	To create a folder structure in tomcat server first have to change configuration in web.xml file.
Change web.xml file located in conf directory of tomcat installed path as below
<init-param>
            <param-name>listings</param-name>
            <param-value>true</param-value>
        </init-param>

( to find for a word in vi editor type as /<word_name>  to find the particular word and use esc + n  to move to the next available word.)
2.	Then create a new directory under webapps directory and in that new directory add files or directories what u want to display in tomcat browser.
Ex : 165.256.6.8:8090/tomcat_test/fca
It will take to fca directory present in tomcat_test directory and displays content i.e; files or directories present under fca directory. If you click on any files it will shows the file content.
