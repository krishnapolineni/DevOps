Branching Stratagies:

- releasing branch: is called master branch. no developer code commits and dvelop here.

- integration branch: 

- sprint branch: an agile sprints we will do both day & night builds.

- future/task branch: basically it is taken from the latest integration that happens.

- changes done at future branch then it will merge to the integration branch. once a day.

- night build done on integration branch.

- once integration branch stable build then it will arrange to the master or release branch.

- hotfix branch: customer raise the bug.

- selinium testing: ui testing
