ansible playbooks
-------------------

--> in playbooks directory located in /etc/ansible/playbook run command as # ansible-galaxy <new dir. name> init , this command will create ansible 
  roles in that new directory as below
     
       +-- defaults
       ¦   +-- main.yml
       +-- files
       +-- handlers
       ¦   +-- main.yml
       +-- meta
       ¦   +-- main.yml
       +-- README.md
       +-- tasks
       ¦   +-- main.yml
       +-- templates
       +-- tests
       ¦   +-- inventory
       ¦   +-- test.yml
       +-- vars
           +-- main.yml

--> also create a directory as environment and in that create directories as how many environments you want as below

  env
   +-- dev
   ¦   +-- group_vars
   ¦   ¦   +-- web          ( this file contains simple text like varible name and it's values like Ex: list_param: true and this value will be copy to all remote machines ) 
   ¦   +-- hosts
   ¦   +-- templates
   ¦       +-- server.xml.j2    ( copy the server.xml file from its absolute path and rename it by adding .j2 as shown and write variable name in that file as shown below)
   ¦       +-- web.xml.j2
   +-- test
               (  <param-name>listings</param-name>
            <param-value>{{ list_param }}</param-value>   here list_param is environmental variable and can change the value by modifying the file 
        located in group_vars ) 
              
   in the above scenario there are dev and test environments and in dev there are sub directories such as group_vars which has a files that contains 
   variables and it's values. values we give in this file will change in remote machines. hosts file contains ip or domain name of remote machines.
   template directory contains .j2 files which are replicas of configuration files or any other files which has to change frequently. 
 --> All the above steps has to be done manually.

--> create a playbook and write as below
            ---
            - name: using template
              hosts: "{{host}}"   ( should give the host name to execute the changes )
              vars_files:
               - env/{{env}}/group_vars/web   (path of variable file that has to execute )
              roles:
               - krish  ( it will trigger krish directory present in roles for further process and in tasks directory present in krish role 
        there is main.yml file and has to write some plays in it as shown below )
             ---
             - name: simple echo
               debug:
               msg: "Connection check 1 2 3 ..."
             - name: conifg modification
               template:
                 src: env/{{env}}/templates/web.xml.j2
                 dest: /etc/tomcat/web.xml
                 mode: 0644
         
--> finally execute command as #ansible-playbook test.yml -i env/dev/hosts -e "host=web env=dev"  to run all the above process to configure 
   the config located in remote machines.
