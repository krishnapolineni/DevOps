Issues faced while installation of SonarQube on Linux server 
1.	Hardware issue : sonarqube needs minimum 2GB RAM and 8 core processor so choose better hardware before start.
      To change ec2 instance hardware, first stop the instance and then click on actions and select instance settings and then select change instance type then a dialog box will appear and then you can select what type you want then save it and start the instance. 
      Check the sonar log file in server where it installed to know the process is running or       not.
# vi /opt/sonar/logs/sonar.log   ( to know the process status )
Ex : If hardware is not enough to run sonarqube the result will be shown as below

2.	Make sure that sonar port number should add in security group of AWS server instance to run the sonarqube in browser. If don’t, sonarqube won't work on browser.
